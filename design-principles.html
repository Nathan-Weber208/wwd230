        <h2>
          Principle 1:Alignment
        </h2>
        <p>
          Alignment is a principle that is never appreciated
          but is infuriating when seen done wrong. Alignment
          is when your elements on your webpage line up,
          have good spacing, and don't overlap.
          <br>
          <br>
          Look at In-and-Out's website below. You
          see it plainly in the images but even in
          the floating text boxes they are justified and
          in conformity. When your eye looks over it, you
          are not annoyed by a 10 pixel difference in
          hight or width.

        <h2>
          Principle 2:Whitespace
        </h2>
        <p>
          The principle of Whitespace is exactly what it
          sounds like. Whitespace (or any background color)
          is used to make your information look more
          important.
          <br>
          <br>
          Look at McDonald's homepage on mobile. Here, they
          use whitespace to show this new coupon for fries.
          they could have used that room for advertizing or
          for something else. it really could have been
          anything they are a multi-billion dollar company.
          Instead its blank so our attention is not pulled
          from what they want us to see.

        <h2>
          Principle 3:Hick's Law
        </h2>
        <p>
          Hick's Law is a simple design principle that is easy to
          follow. Don't give the user too many options. Your webpage
          should not look like a cockpit with buttons and toggles
          everywhere. Rather give the user a very straight-forward
          path as not to be confused.
          <br>
          <br>
          Doorzza's example is a comical extreme. When you load up
          the webpage you are shown your choice: "Order Now" There
          is no other reason for you to look up this site. Sure if
          you scroll around you'll find some more options but the
          intended path is clear.
